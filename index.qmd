# 🧩 Course Structure

We’ll be following a **flipped classroom** strategy:

-   During the week, you’ll study the core concepts at your own pace — whether at home, in the library, or even in the park (it’s the summer term after all!).

-   At the beginning of each seminar, we’ll clear up any open questions before diving into **active problem-solving** and **programming**.

-   Expect a mix of hands-on coding, small-group discussions, and the occasional productive chaos when things don’t work as expected (that’s part of the learning process!).

# 🛠️ Requirements

-   Most importantly: Sociological curiosity – An interest in social behavior and experiments is essential. If you’re not genuinely curious about how people behave and why, this course might not be for you! -
-   Basic R programming skills – You should be comfortable reading and understanding R code (including functions). You don’t need to be an expert, but you should know the basics.
-   A Laptop with R and RStudio installed and running. If you don’t have a laptop (yes, this can happen!), don’t hesitate to contact us ([sascha.grehl\@uni-leipzig.de](mailto:sascha.grehl@uni-leipzig.de){.email} or [leonie.steinbrinker\@uni-leipzig.de](mailto:leonie.steinbrinker@uni-leipzig.de){.email}) — we’ll work something out.
-   Paper and pen – Digital or analog, as long as you can sketch out your ideas and map your thoughts.
-   A sense of humor – Things will break, code will crash, and unexpected results will happen — that’s all part of the process.[^1]

[^1]: *A good tip from someone who’s spent hours raging over broken code:* The problem is 99.99999% of the time sitting **in front of the screen**. You probably made a silly mistake and just aren’t spotting it right now. Keep calm, drink some tea and relax. In this respect, ChatGPT changed my life — just ask it where the error is, and it will usually confront you with your obvious mistake.

# 🎓 Formal Requirements

In order to successfully complete the course the following requirements are to be met:

-   **Pre-examination requirement (*Prüfungsvorleistung*)**: At least 50% of the points in the 6 problem sets (*Übungsblätter*)
-   **Course assessment (*Prüfungsleistung*)**: The final grade is determined by the assessment of the term paper. (*Hausarbeit*).

You can find more details under [**Course Assessment**](https://sgrehl.github.io/general-information/exam.html).
